I used this script to generate the visualizations for [my fantasy football post](http://truebra.in/?p=1512 "True Brain - A Data Visualization of Fantasy Football Points per Position") on my blog, [True Brain](http://truebra.in/ "True Brain").

Data from [Pro Football Reference](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2015/fantasy.htm). You should be able to download the data straight from PFR (ideally in any year) and use it with this script. 
This is a MATLAB script. I used [gramm](https://github.com/piermorel/gramm) for visualizations; everything else should run out of the box.
